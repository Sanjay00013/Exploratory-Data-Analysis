United Nations Global Terrorism Analysis (UNGTA) Dataset Project
Project Overview
The United Nations Global Terrorism Analysis (UNGTA) dataset provides a comprehensive repository of terrorist incidents recorded from 1970 to 2017. With over 180,000 incidents, this dataset offers valuable insights into the evolving landscape of terrorism across the globe. This project aims to explore, analyze, and visualize the data to uncover patterns and trends related to terrorist activities.

Key Features of the Dataset
Event Specifics: Detailed records of terrorist attacks, including date, location, and nature of the incident (e.g., assassination, bombing, hostage-taking).

Geographic and Demographic Information: Insights into affected geographic regions, including country, region, and city specifics, as well as details about targeted groups or individuals.

Attack Details: Information on attack methods, weapons involved, and the nature of the attack (e.g., explosive, incendiary, or armed assault).

Impact Assessment: Data on casualties, including the number of killed or wounded, and any property damage or ransom demands associated with the attacks.

Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and aggregation.
NumPy: For computationally efficient operations.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations to represent data findings.
Seaborn: For advanced statistical visualizations and behavior analysis with respect to the target variable.
Analysis Overview
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Load the dataset.
Handle missing values.
Convert date fields to datetime objects.
Filter out unnecessary columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the trends in terrorist incidents over the years.
Analyze the distribution of attacks by type and method.
Assess the impact of attacks based on casualties and damage.
Examine geographic patterns in terrorist activities.
Visualization Techniques:

Use Matplotlib and Seaborn for at least five different visualizations, such as:
Time series plots of incidents.
Bar charts for types of attacks.
Heatmaps for geographical data.
Histograms for casualty distribution.
Box plots for comparing different attack types.


Conclusion
This project provides a foundational understanding of global terrorist incidents using the UNGTA dataset. By utilizing various data analysis and visualization techniques, we aim to uncover significant insights that can inform policymakers and researchers in addressing the challenges posed by terrorism.
